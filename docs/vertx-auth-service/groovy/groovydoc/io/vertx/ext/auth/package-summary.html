 = Vert.x Auth Service

 This Vert.x service provides authentication and authorisation functionality for use in your Vert.x applications.

 The auth service provides a common interface that can be backed by different auth providers. Vert.x ships with a
 default implementation that uses http://shiro.apache.org/[Apache Shiro] but you can provide your own implementation
 by implementing the io.vertx.ext.auth.AuthProvider interface. The Vert.x Apache Shiro implementation
 currently allows user/role/permission information to be accessed from simple properties files or LDAP servers.

 The auth service can either be used directly in your application, but it also integrated with the auth functionality
 in Vert.x Apex.

 == Basic concepts

 _Authentication_ (aka _log in_) means verifying the identity of a user.

 _Authorisation_ means verifying a user has the correct access rights for some resource.

 The service uses a familiar user/role/permission model that you will probably know already:

 Users can have zero or more roles, e.g. "manager", "developer".

 Roles can have zero or more permissions, e.g. a manager might have permission "approve expenses", "conduct_reviews",
 and a developer might have a permission "commit_code".

 == Setting up the service

 As with other services you can use the service either by deploying it as a verticle somewhere on your network and
 interacting with it over the event bus, either directly by sending messages, or using a service proxy, e.g.

 Somewhere you deploy it:

 [source,java]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example0_1
 ----

 Now you can either send messages to it directly over the event bus, or you can create a proxy to the service
 from wherever you are and just use that:

 [source,java]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example0_2
 ----

 Alternatively you can create an instance of the service directly and just use that locally:

 [source,java]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example0_3
 ----

 If you create an instance this way you should make sure you start it with io.vertx.ext.auth.AuthService#start
 before you use it.

 However you do it, once you've got your service you can start using it.

 == Shiro Auth Service

 As previously mentioned we provide an implementation of the Auth service that uses Apache Shiro to perform the
 actual auth.

 To use this, you should use io.vertx.ext.auth.shiro.ShiroAuthService.

 This currently supports properties file based user/role/permission information and using LDAP, and you can also pass
 in a pre-existing Shiro `Realm` instance or implement <a href='../../../../io/vertx/ext/auth/shiro/ShiroAuthRealm.html' title='ShiroAuthRealm'>ShiroAuthRealm</a> to implement
 a different method of auth using Shiro.

 == Shiro Auth Service Verticle

 As with most services you can deploy the service somewhere on your network and interact with it via a proxy, here's
 an example of deploying a Shiro auth service verticle:

 [source,java]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example0_3_1
 ----

 === Properties auth realm

 The properties auth realm gets user/role/permission information from a properties file.

 Here's an example that uses the out of the box properties auth realm:

 [source,java]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example0_4
 ----

 The properties auth realm will, by default, look for a file called `vertx-users.properties`
 on the classpath.

 If you want to change this, you can use the `properties_path` configuration element to define how the properties
 file is found.

 The default value is `classpath:vertx-users.properties`.

 If the value is prefixed with `classpath:` then the classpath will be searched for a properties file of that name.

 If the value is prefixed with `file:` then it specifies a file on the file system.

 If the value is prefixed with `url:` then it specifies a URL from where to load the properties.

 The properties file should have the following structure:

 Each line should either contain the username, password and roles for a user or the permissions in a role.

 For a user line it should be of the form:

  user.{username}={password},{roleName1},{roleName2},...,{roleNameN}

 For a role line it should be of the form:

  role.{roleName}={permissionName1},{permissionName2},...,{permissionNameN}

 Here's an example:
 ----
 user.tim = mypassword,administrator,developer
 user.bob = hispassword,developer
 user.joe = anotherpassword,manager
 role.administrator=*
 role.manager=play_golf,say_buzzwords
 role.developer=do_actual_work
 ----

 When describing roles a wildcard `*` can be used to indicate that the role has all permissions

 === LDAP auth realm

 The LDAP auth realm gets user/role/permission information from an LDAP server.

 The following configuration properties are used to configure the LDAP realm:

 `ldap-user-dn-template`:: this is used to determine the actual lookup to use when looking up a user with a particular
 id. An example is `uid={0},ou=users,dc=foo,dc=com` - the element `{0}` is substituted with the user id to create the
 actual lookup. This setting is mandatory.
 `ldap_url`:: the url to the LDAP server. The url must start with `ldap://` and a port must be specified.
 An example is `ldap:://myldapserver.mycompany.com:10389`
 `ldap-authentication-mechanism`:: TODO
 `ldap-context-factory-class-name`:: TODO
 `ldap-pooling-enabled`:: TODO
 `ldap-referral`:: TODO
 `ldap-system-username`:: TODO
 `ldap-system-password`:: TODO

 == Using non Shiro Auth implementations

 If you want to use a different auth provider with the Auth service, you should implement io.vertx.ext.auth.AuthProvider.

 You can then create a local instance of the AuthService with:

 [source,$lang]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example0_5
 ----

 Or to to deploy an verticle instance:

 [source,$lang]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example0_6
 ----

 == Using the API

 The auth service API is described with io.vertx.ext.auth.AuthService.

 It contains method to login and check roles and permissions.

 === Authentication - login / logout

 You use io.vertx.ext.auth.AuthService#login to login a user. The arguments to log-in are a io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject
 representing the principal (principal is a fancy name for a unique id, e.g. username representing the user), and
 another io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject representing the credentials (e.g. password) of the user.

 Often the principal will just contain a `username` string field - the value containing the username and this is what is
 expected by the out of the box Apache Shiro provider, but other providers might represent principals in other ways.

 Similarly, the credentials will often just be a `password` string field -  the value containing a password but other
 providers might use other data for credentials that's why we keep it as a general JSON object.

 The result of the login is returned in the result handler. If the login is successful a string login-ID will be returned
 as the result. This is a unique secure UUID that identifies the login session. The login ID should be used if you
 later want to authorise the user, i.e. check whether they have permissions or roles.

 Here's an example of a login:

 [source,$lang]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example1
 ----

 The login session ID provided at login will be valid as long as the login hasn't timed out or been explicitly
 logged out.

 The default time it remains valid is 30 minutes. If you want to use a different value of timeout you can specify that
 by calling io.vertx.ext.auth.AuthService#loginWithTimeout.

 To prevent a login timing out, you can call io.vertx.ext.auth.AuthService#refreshLoginSession specifying
 the login ID. The login will timeout if it remains unrefreshed for greater than the timeout period.

 [source,$lang]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example2
 ----

 You can explicitly logout a user with io.vertx.ext.auth.AuthService#logout specifying the login ID:

 [source,$lang]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example3
 ----

 === Authorisation

 Authorisation means checking whether the user has the right roles or permissions.

 In order to check roles or permissions the user must first be logged-in and you must have a valid login session ID
 as described in the previous section.

 To check if a user has a specific role you use io.vertx.ext.auth.AuthService#hasRole specifying the login ID
 and the role.

 The result of the check is returned in the handler. If the check didn't occur - e.g. the login ID is not valid, a
 failure will be returned in the handler, otherwise it will return a boolean - true if the user has the role
 or false if they don't have the role.

 [source,$lang]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example4
 ----

 You can also check multiple roles at the same time with io.vertx.ext.auth.AuthService#hasRoles. In this
 case you will return a true result only if the user has _all_ the specified roles.

 In the same way as checking roles, you can check permissions too. To this you use
 io.vertx.ext.auth.AuthService#hasPermission and
 io.vertx.ext.auth.AuthService#hasPermissions in the exact same way as roles.

 Authorisations are cached for the length of the login. This means that the first time you do authorisation for a user
 it will go the auth provider, but the second time you do it with the same roles and permissions it will not call the
 auth provider but will return the cached value.

 This allows better performance but bear in mind that if the roles
 or permissions for a user change in the provider while the login session is valid and when they have already been
 cached in the auth service, then the auth service won't see the changes in the provider until a new login session
 is started.<DL><DT><B>author:</B></DT><DD><a href="mailto:julien@julienviet.com">Julien Viet</a></DD></DL><DL><DT><B>author:</B></DT><DD><a href="http://tfox.org">Tim Fox</a></DD></DL>
