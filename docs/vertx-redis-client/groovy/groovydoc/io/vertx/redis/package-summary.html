 Vert.x-redis is redis client to be used with Vert.x.

 This module allows data to be saved, retrieved, searched for, and deleted in a Redis. Redis is an open source, BSD
 licensed, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain
 strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets. To use this module you must have a Redis server instance running on
 your network.

 Redis has a rich API and it can be organized in the following groups:
 Cluster - Commands related to cluster management, note that using most of these commands you will need a redis server with version &lt;=3.0.0
 Connection - Commands that allow you to switch DBs, connect, disconnect and authenticate to a server.
 Hashes - Commands that allow operations on hashes.
 HyperLogLog - Commands to approximating the number of distinct elements in a multiset, a HyperLogLog.
 Keys - Commands to work with Keys.
 List - Commands to work with Lists.
 Pub/Sub - Commands to create queues and pub/sub clients.
 Scripting - Commands to run Lua Scripts in redis.
 Server - Commands to manage and get server configurations.
 Sets - Commands to work with un ordered sets.
 Sorted Sets - Commands to work with sorted sets.
 Strings - Commands to work with Strings.
 Transactions - Commands to handle transaction lifecycle.

 == Connecting to Redis

 In order to connect to Redis there is a config required. This config is provided in the form of io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject
 containing the following values:
 `host`: default is `localhost`
 `port`: default is `6379`
 `encoding`: default is `UTF-8`

 An connection example can then be:

 [source,$lang]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example1
 ----

 == Running commands

 Given that the redis client is connected to the server, all commands are now possible to execute using this module.
 The module offers a clean API for executing commands without the need to hand write the command itself, for example
 if one wants to get a value of a key it can be done as:

 [source,$lang]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example2
 ----

 In order to know more about the commands available you should look at: <a href="http://redis.io/commands">redis documentation</a>.

 == Pub/Sub mode

 Redis supports queues and pub/sub mode, when operated in this mode once a connection invokes a subscriber mode then
 it cannot be used for running other commands than the command to leave that mode.

 To start a subscriber one would do:

 [source,$lang]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example3
 ----

 And from another place in the code publish messages to the queue:

 [source,$lang]
 ----
 examples.Examples#example4
 ----

 == Friendlier hash commands

 Most Redis commands take a single String or an Array of Strings as arguments, and replies are sent back as a single
 String or an Array of Strings. When dealing with hash values, there are a couple of useful exceptions to this.

 === Command hgetall

 The reply from an hgetall command will be converted into a JSON Object. That way you can interact with the responses
 using JSON syntax which is handy for the EventBus communication.

 === command mset

 Multiple values in a hash can be set by supplying an object. Note however that key and value will be coerced to
 strings.

 <pre>
 {
   keyName: "value",
   otherKeyName: "other value"
 }
 </pre>

 === command msetnx

 Multiple values in a hash can be set by supplying an object. Note however that key and value will be coerced to
 strings.

 <pre>
 {
   keyName: "value",
   otherKeyName: "other value"
 }
 </pre>

 === command hmset

 Multiple values in a hash can be set by supplying an object. Note however that key and value will be coerced to
 strings.

 <pre>
 {
   keyName: "value",
   otherKeyName: "other value"
 }
 </pre>

 === command zadd
 Multiple values in a hash can be set by supplying an object. Note however that key and value will be coerced to
 strings.

 <pre>
 {
   score: "member",
   otherScore: "other member"
 }
 </pre>

 == Server Info

 In order to make it easier to work with the info response you don't need to parse the data yourself and the module
 will return it in a easy to understand JSON format. The format is as follows: A JSON object for each section filled
 with properties that belong to that section. If for some reason there is no section the properties will be visible
 at the top level object.

 <pre>
 {
   server: {
     redis_version: "2.5.13",
     redis_git_sha1: "2812b945",
     redis_git_dirty: "0",
     os: "Linux 2.6.32.16-linode28 i686",
     arch_bits: "32",
     multiplexing_api: "epoll",
     gcc_version: "4.4.1",
     process_id: "8107",
     ...
   },
   memory: {...},
   client: {...},
   ...
 }
 </pre>
